# Release v0.1 — Quickstart, demo, and transparency checklist

**Summary**  
v0.1 publishes the README hero, demo scaffolds (OpenAI/Anthropic/PaLM templates), issue & PR templates, CONTRIBUTING guidelines, and an ETHICS & Data Redaction policy.

**Where to start**
1. `README.md` top-of-repo hero and Quickstart.  
2. `demo/` — scaffolds for running quick reproducibility tests.  
3. `ETHICS.md` — required reading before publishing logs.

**Call to action**

- Suggest literature or raise methodological concerns via issues or PRs.

**Changelog (high level)**
- Add: README hero, demo scripts, `.github` templates, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `ETHICS.md`, `LICENSE`.
